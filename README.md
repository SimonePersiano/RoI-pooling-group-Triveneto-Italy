# RoI-pooling-group-Triveneto-Italy
Here is a dataset of annual maximum series (AMS) of peak flow discharges collected for a possibly homogeneous 
pooling-group of 20 nested catchments in Triveneto (North-Eastern Italy), identified by means of the 
Region of Influence (RoI) approach (see e.g. Burn, 1990).

In the attribute table of the shapefile, the following data area provided for each catchment:
- Code: station ID;
- Region: region;
- Gauge: name of the gauging station;
- Area_km2: drainage area [km^2];
- MAP: Mean Annual Precipitation [mm];
- Hmin: minimum elevation [m a.s.l.];
- Hmean: mean elevation  [m a.s.l.];
- X_UTM32: longitude of catchment's centroid in WGS84 UTM32N;
- Y_UTM32: latitude of catchment's centroid in WGS84 UTM32N; 
- N: record lenght;
- Mean: Mean Annual Flood [(m^3)/s]
- DEV_STD: Standard deviation;
- CV: coefficiente of variation;
- fields from X1913 to X2012: annual maximum flood [(m^3)/s] recorded for the given year.
